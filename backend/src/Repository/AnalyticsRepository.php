 * 
 * Key functionalities:
 * - Dashboard statistics and KPIs
 * - User behavior analytics and engagement metrics
 * - Design performance tracking (views, exports, shares)
 * - Template usage analytics and popularity rankings
 * - Export job analytics and processing statistics
 * - System performance monitoring and health metrics
 * - Time-series data for trend analysis
 * - Platform-wide statistics for admin reporting
 * 
 * The repository uses optimized native SQL queries for complex aggregations
 * and time-series data to ensure fast response times for analytics dashboards.
