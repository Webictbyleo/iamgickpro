# Upload Constraint Enforcement - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented upload constraint enforcement in the MediaController and MediaService, completing the subscription system implementation. Users can no longer upload files that would exceed their plan's storage limits.

## Implementation Details

### MediaService Changes
**File**: `src/Service/MediaService.php`

#### Dependencies Added:
- `SubscriptionConstraintService` injection in constructor
- `SubscriptionLimitExceededException` import

#### Upload Method Enhanced:
```php
public function uploadFile(UploadedFile $file, User $user, ?string $alt = null): Media
{
    $this->validateFile($file);
    
    // Check storage limit before uploading
    $fileSize = $file->getSize();
    $this->subscriptionConstraintService->enforceFileUploadLimit($user, $fileSize);
    
    // ... continue with existing upload logic
}
```

#### Key Features:
- **Early Validation**: Storage limits checked before any file processing
- **Preserves Existing Logic**: All existing validation (file type, size, MIME type) remains unchanged
- **Proper Exception Handling**: Throws `SubscriptionLimitExceededException` when limits exceeded
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing upload workflows continue to work

### MediaController Changes
**File**: `src/Controller/MediaController.php`

#### Exception Handling Enhanced:
```php
} catch (SubscriptionLimitExceededException $e) {
    $errorResponse = $this->responseDTOFactory->createErrorResponse(
        'Storage limit exceeded',
        [$e->getMessage()]
    );
    return $this->errorResponse($errorResponse, Response::HTTP_PAYMENT_REQUIRED);
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    // ... existing exception handling
}
```

#### Key Features:
- **Specific Exception Handling**: Dedicated handling for subscription limit exceptions
- **Proper HTTP Status Code**: Returns 402 Payment Required for limit exceeded
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages for frontend consumption
- **Maintains API Consistency**: Same response format as other error cases

### Service Configuration
**File**: `config/services.yaml`

#### MediaService Configuration:
```yaml
App\Service\MediaService:
    public: true  # Added for testing access
    arguments:
        $mediaUploadDirectory: '%app.media_directory%'
        $thumbnailDirectory: '%app.thumbnail_directory%'
        $maxFileSize: 10485760 # 10MB
        $allowedMimeTypes: [...]
```

#### Key Features:
- **Automatic Dependency Injection**: SubscriptionConstraintService automatically injected
- **Public Service**: Available for console commands and testing
- **Maintained Configuration**: All existing settings preserved

## Integration Points

### 1. Upload Flow
```
User uploads file → MediaController::upload() → MediaService::uploadFile() → 
SubscriptionConstraintService::enforceFileUploadLimit() → Storage validation → 
Continue upload OR throw exception
```

### 2. Constraint Checking
- **Storage Calculation**: Current user storage usage calculated from existing media files
- **Limit Retrieval**: User's plan limits fetched from database
- **Validation Logic**: File size + current usage compared against plan limit
- **Exception Handling**: Descriptive error messages with usage information

### 3. API Response Format
```json
// Success (201 Created)
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Media uploaded successfully",
    "data": { /* media object */ }
}

// Storage limit exceeded (402 Payment Required)
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "Storage limit exceeded",
    "errors": ["Detailed limit exceeded message"]
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

### For Users:
- **Transparent Limits**: Clear understanding of storage constraints
- **Helpful Error Messages**: Detailed information about current usage and limits
- **Consistent Experience**: Upload constraints enforced uniformly across all upload methods

### For Administrators:
- **Automated Enforcement**: No manual intervention required for limit enforcement
- **Plan Flexibility**: Can adjust storage limits dynamically through admin API
- **Usage Tracking**: Accurate storage usage calculation for billing/analytics

### For Developers:
- **Clean Architecture**: Constraint logic centralized in dedicated service
- **Easy Testing**: Services can be mocked for unit testing
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new constraint types (bandwidth, API calls, etc.)

## Technical Implementation

### Constraint Enforcement Flow:
1. **File Upload Request** → MediaController receives upload request
2. **Basic Validation** → MediaService validates file type, size, etc.
3. **Storage Check** → SubscriptionConstraintService calculates current usage
4. **Limit Comparison** → Compare (current + new file) against plan limit
5. **Decision** → Allow upload OR throw SubscriptionLimitExceededException
6. **Response** → Return success with media data OR error with constraint details

### Storage Calculation Logic:
```php
// In SubscriptionConstraintService
private function calculateUserStorageUsage(User $user): int
{
    $qb = $this->entityManager->createQueryBuilder();
    $qb->select('SUM(m.size)')
       ->from(Media::class, 'm')
       ->where('m.user = :user')
       ->setParameter('user', $user);
    
    return (int) $qb->getQuery()->getSingleScalarResult() ?: 0;
}
```

### Exception Handling:
```php
// Specific exception with detailed message
throw new SubscriptionLimitExceededException(
    "Storage limit exceeded. Your current plan allows " . $this->formatBytes($storageLimit) . 
    " of storage, but you're trying to upload " . $this->formatBytes($fileSizeBytes) . 
    " which would exceed your limit."
);
```

## Validation Results

### ✅ Implementation Verified:
- MediaService properly injected with SubscriptionConstraintService
- Upload method calls enforceFileUploadLimit() before processing
- Exception handling properly configured
- Service dependencies correctly wired
- HTTP status codes appropriate for each scenario

### ✅ Architecture Compliance:
- Constraint enforcement in service layer (not controller)
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper exception hierarchy
- Consistent error response format

### ✅ Integration Complete:
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All upload endpoints protected by constraints
- Database-driven plan limits properly enforced
- Admin plan management affects upload constraints immediately

## Next Steps

### Immediate Recommendations:
1. **Frontend Integration**: Update upload UI to handle 402 Payment Required responses
2. **Progress Indicators**: Show storage usage progress bars in user dashboard
3. **Upgrade Prompts**: Guide users to upgrade when approaching limits

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Bandwidth Limits**: Extend constraint system to monthly bandwidth usage
2. **File Type Restrictions**: Plan-based file type limitations
3. **Usage Analytics**: Detailed storage usage reporting and trends
4. **Automated Cleanup**: Remove old files when approaching limits (with user consent)

## Summary

✅ **Upload constraint enforcement is now fully implemented and integrated**

The subscription system is now complete with dynamic plan management, comprehensive constraint enforcement, and a robust admin interface. Users are automatically prevented from exceeding their storage limits during file uploads, ensuring fair usage and enabling sustainable business operations.

All upload operations now respect subscription limits while maintaining the existing user experience for uploads within limits. The implementation follows best practices for service architecture, exception handling, and API design.
