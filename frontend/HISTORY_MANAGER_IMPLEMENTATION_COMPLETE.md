# HistoryManager Implementation - Undo/Redo Functionality Improvements

## Overview

The undo/redo functionality has been completely rewritten using a modern Command Pattern architecture to provide robust, reliable, and extensible history management for the design editor.

## Problems with the Previous Implementation

### 1. Simple State-Based Approach
- **Issue**: Stored raw state data instead of reversible commands
- **Impact**: Difficult to handle complex operations and edge cases
- **Example**: Layer updates couldn't be properly reversed due to missing context

### 2. Inconsistent State Management
- **Issue**: `applyHistoryState` method manually handled different operation types
- **Impact**: Error-prone and hard to maintain
- **Example**: Reordering layers didn't properly restore previous state

### 3. No Command Composition
- **Issue**: Each operation created a separate history entry
- **Impact**: Rapid operations cluttered history and poor UX
- **Example**: Dragging a layer created dozens of history entries

### 4. Limited Error Handling
- **Issue**: Failed undo/redo operations could corrupt the editor state
- **Impact**: Users could lose work or encounter broken states
- **Example**: Undoing a deleted layer when the layer data was corrupted

## New HistoryManager Architecture

### 1. Command Pattern Implementation

```typescript
interface Command {
  id: string
  description: string
  timestamp: number
  execute(): Promise<void> | void
  undo(): Promise<void> | void
  canExecute(): boolean
  canUndo(): boolean
  merge?(other: Command): Command | null
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Each operation is encapsulated as a reversible command
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test and debug individual operations
- Type-safe command execution

### 2. Specialized Command Types

#### CreateLayerCommand
- **Purpose**: Handles layer creation with full context
- **Execute**: No-op (layer already created)
- **Undo**: Removes the layer using LayerManager
- **Validation**: Checks if layer exists before undo

#### DeleteLayerCommand
- **Purpose**: Handles layer deletion with restoration capability
- **Execute**: No-op (layer already deleted)
- **Undo**: Recreates layer with all original properties
- **Validation**: Ensures layer doesn't exist before recreation

#### UpdateLayerCommand
- **Purpose**: Handles property updates with merge capability
- **Execute**: Applies new properties
- **Undo**: Restores previous properties
- **Merge**: Combines rapid updates within 1-second window

#### ReorderLayersCommand
- **Purpose**: Handles layer reordering
- **Execute**: Applies new layer order
- **Undo**: Restores previous layer order
- **Validation**: Ensures all layers exist

#### CompoundCommand
- **Purpose**: Groups multiple commands for complex operations
- **Execute**: Executes all sub-commands in order
- **Undo**: Undoes all sub-commands in reverse order
- **Use Case**: Drag-and-drop with multiple property changes

### 3. Advanced Features

#### Command Merging
```typescript
merge(other: Command): Command | null {
  if (other instanceof UpdateLayerCommand && 
      other.layerId === this.layerId && 
      (other.timestamp - this.timestamp) < 1000) {
    return new UpdateLayerCommand(
      this.layerManager,
      this.layerId,
      this.oldData, // Keep original old data
      other.newData, // Use latest new data
      this.emitter
    )
  }
  return null
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents history pollution from rapid operations
- Maintains semantic meaning of user actions
- Configurable merge time window
- Preserves undo granularity where it matters

#### Error Recovery
```typescript
undo(): boolean {
  if (!this.canUndo()) return false
  
  try {
    this.isExecutingCommand = true
    command.undo()
    this.currentIndex--
    return true
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Undo failed:', error)
    return false
  } finally {
    this.isExecutingCommand = false
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Graceful handling of failed operations
- State consistency maintained even on errors
- Detailed error reporting for debugging
- Recovery mechanisms for corrupted states

#### Memory Management
```typescript
if (this.commands.length > this.maxHistorySize) {
  this.commands.shift()
  this.currentIndex--
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Configurable history size limits
- Automatic cleanup of old commands
- Memory usage stays bounded
- Performance optimization for long sessions

## Integration with EditorSDK

### 1. Clean API Interface
```typescript
// Public methods in EditorSDK
undo(): void
redo(): void
getHistoryState(): HistoryState
clearHistory(): void
```

### 2. LayerManager Integration
```typescript
// In LayerManager operations
if (!silent && this.historyManager) {
  this.historyManager.addCreateLayerCommand(layerNode)
}
```

### 3. Event System
```typescript
// History state changes are broadcast
this.emit('history:changed', {
  canUndo: state.canUndo,
  canRedo: state.canRedo,
  currentIndex: state.currentIndex,
  totalCommands: state.totalCommands,
  undoDescription: state.undoDescription,
  redoDescription: state.redoDescription
})
```

## UI Integration

### 1. Toolbar Integration
- Undo/Redo buttons automatically enable/disable based on history state
- Tooltips show description of next undo/redo operation
- Visual feedback for history state changes

### 2. Keyboard Shortcuts
- Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z for undo
- Ctrl+Y / Cmd+Y for redo
- Proper event handling and prevention

### 3. Status Indicators
- Real-time display of history state
- Command descriptions for user clarity
- Error state indication

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Lazy Execution
- Commands store minimal data
- Heavy operations only executed when needed
- Efficient memory usage patterns

### 2. Batch Operations
- Multiple related changes grouped into compound commands
- Reduced event emission overhead
- Better user experience for complex operations

### 3. Silent Operations
- Internal operations bypass history (e.g., during undo/redo)
- Prevents infinite loops
- Maintains operation semantics

## Testing and Validation

### 1. Automated Test Suite
- Comprehensive command testing
- Edge case validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Memory leak detection

### 2. Manual Testing Scenarios
- Rapid user interactions
- Complex operation sequences
- Error condition handling
- Recovery from corrupted states

### 3. Integration Testing
- Cross-component interaction validation
- Event system testing
- UI state synchronization
- Persistence testing

## Migration Benefits

- **Branching**: Support for history branching and merging
- **Export**: Export history for debugging and analysis

### 3. Performance Enhancements

  maxHistorySize: 100,
  mergeTimeWindow: 1000,
  enableMerging: true,
  compressionEnabled: false,

})
```

This new implementation provides a robust foundation for undo/redo functionality that can scale with the application's growing complexity while maintaining excellent performance and user experience.
