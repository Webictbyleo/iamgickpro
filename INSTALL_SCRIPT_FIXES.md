# Install Script Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PSR-4 Autoloading Violations
**Problem**: Multiple classes were defined in single files, violating PSR-4 autoloading standards.

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/Service/Plugin/SecureRequestBuilder.php` - Split `ServiceRequestBuilder` class into separate file
- `src/Service/MediaProcessing/Config/ProcessingConfig.php` - Renamed to `ImageProcessingConfig.php` and removed duplicate classes
- Created separate files for `VideoProcessingConfig` and `AudioProcessingConfig`

**Solution**: Each class now has its own file matching the PSR-4 naming convention.

### 2. DebugBundle Loading Issue
**Problem**: Symfony was trying to load DebugBundle (dev dependency) during production installation.

**Root Cause**: The `composer install --no-dev` command was running before the production environment file was created, so Symfony read `APP_ENV=dev` from the original `.env` file.

**Solution**: 
- Moved environment file creation to occur BEFORE composer install
- Added `APP_ENV=prod` environment variable to the composer install command
- Added `--no-scripts` flag to avoid problematic post-install scripts

### 3. Updated Import Statements
**Problem**: Some files were importing the removed `ProcessingConfig` class.

**Solution**: Updated `MediaProcessingService.php` import statement to remove reference to non-existent class.

## Installation Process Changes

1. **Environment Configuration First**: The `.env.local` file with production settings is now created before running composer install
2. **Explicit Environment Variables**: Composer install runs with `APP_ENV=prod` to ensure production mode
3. **Script Handling**: Post-install scripts are skipped during composer install and cache warmup is done manually afterward
4. **Error Handling**: Cache warmup failures don't halt the installation process

## Files Modified

- `/var/www/html/iamgickpro/install.sh` - Updated installation order and environment handling
- `/var/www/html/iamgickpro/backend/src/Service/Plugin/SecureRequestBuilder.php` - Removed duplicate class
- `/var/www/html/iamgickpro/backend/src/Service/Plugin/ServiceRequestBuilder.php` - New file created
- `/var/www/html/iamgickpro/backend/src/Service/MediaProcessing/Config/ProcessingConfig.php` - Renamed to `ImageProcessingConfig.php`
- `/var/www/html/iamgickpro/backend/src/Service/MediaProcessing/MediaProcessingService.php` - Updated imports

## Result

The installation script should now successfully complete the "Install backend dependencies..." stage without PSR-4 autoloading warnings or DebugBundle errors.
