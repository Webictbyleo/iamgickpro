# Undo/Redo History Reset Bug Fix - Complete

## Problem Analysis

The issue was identified correctly: when clicking the undo button, the redo button would become disabled because the undo operation was inadvertently resetting the history stack. Additionally, undo/redo operations were causing unwanted visual flashing due to auto-fit triggers.

### Root Causes

1. **History Stack Reset**:
   - User clicks undo in ModernToolbar
   - `undo()` calls `historyUndo()` to get previous design state
   - `undo()` calls `editorSDK.value.loadDesign(previousDesign)` to restore the editor state
   - `loadDesign()` triggers the `design:loaded` event
   - Event handler calls `initializeHistory()` which **resets the entire history stack**
   - Redo stack gets lost, redo button becomes disabled

2. **Visual Flashing During Undo/Redo**:
   - `loadDesign()` triggers `design:loaded` event
   - Event handler emits `editor:auto-fit-request` event
   - EditorLayout receives auto-fit request and fits canvas to screen
   - This causes unwanted visual flashing during undo/redo operations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added History Operation Flag

Added `isPerformingHistoryOperation` flag in `useDesignEditor` to track when undo/redo operations are in progress:

```typescript
const isPerformingHistoryOperation = ref(false) // Flag to prevent history reset during undo/redo
```

### 2. Updated Design:Loaded Event Handler

Modified the `design:loaded` event handler to:
- Skip history initialization during undo/redo operations
- Skip auto-fit requests during undo/redo operations to prevent flashing

```typescript
// Only initialize history if we're not performing an undo/redo operation
if (!isPerformingHistoryOperation.value && designStore.currentDesign) {
  initializeHistory(designStore.currentDesign, 'Design loaded')
  console.log('📋 History initialized with loaded design')
} else if (isPerformingHistoryOperation.value) {
  console.log('📋 Skipped history initialization during undo/redo operation')
}

// Emit auto-fit event only if we're not performing a history operation
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && !isPerformingHistoryOperation.value) {
  const autoFitEvent = new CustomEvent('editor:auto-fit-request', { 
    detail: { reason: 'design-loaded', design } 
  })
  document.dispatchEvent(autoFitEvent)
  console.log('📐 Auto-fit request sent for design loading')
} else if (isPerformingHistoryOperation.value) {
  console.log('📐 Auto-fit skipped during undo/redo operation to prevent flashing')
}
```

### 3. Enhanced LoadDesign Function

Updated the `loadDesign` function to always reset the history operation flag:

```typescript
const loadDesign = async (designId?: string) => {
  try {
    // ... load design logic
  } finally {
    // Always reset the history operation flag when loadDesign completes
    isPerformingHistoryOperation.value = false
  }
}
```

### 4. Simplified Undo/Redo Methods

Simplified the undo/redo methods since the flag reset is now handled in `loadDesign`:

```typescript
const undo = () => {
  if (!canUndo.value) return
  
  console.log('🔄 Starting undo operation...')
  isPerformingHistoryOperation.value = true
  
  const previousDesign = historyUndo()
  if (previousDesign && designStore.currentDesign && editorSDK.value) {
    // Update store state
    if (previousDesign.layers) {
      designStore.currentDesign.layers = [...previousDesign.layers]
    }
    
    // Reload design (loadDesign will reset the flag)
    editorSDK.value.loadDesign(previousDesign)
    
    hasUnsavedChanges.value = true
    console.log('✨ Undo operation initiated - design state will be restored')
  } else {
    isPerformingHistoryOperation.value = false
  }
}
```

### 5. Fixed Duplicate Method Declarations

Removed duplicate `handleUndo` and `handleRedo` method declarations in `EditorLayout.vue` that were causing TypeScript compilation errors.

## Flow After Complete Fix

### Normal Design Loading (History Initialized, Auto-fit Enabled)
```
User loads design
→ EditorSDK loads design
→ 'design:loaded' event fired
→ isPerformingHistoryOperation = false
→ History initialized with loaded design ✅
→ Auto-fit request sent ✅
→ Canvas fits to screen smoothly ✅
```

### Undo Operation (History Preserved, No Flashing)
```
User clicks Undo
→ isPerformingHistoryOperation = true
→ Get previous state from history
→ Update design store
→ Load previous state into editor
→ 'design:loaded' event fired
→ isPerformingHistoryOperation = true
   → Skip history initialization ✅
   → Skip auto-fit request ✅
→ loadDesign completes
→ isPerformingHistoryOperation = false
→ History stack preserved, redo available! ✅
→ No visual flashing! ✅
```

### Redo Operation (History Preserved, No Flashing)
```
User clicks Redo
→ isPerformingHistoryOperation = true
→ Get next state from history
→ Update design store
→ Load next state into editor
→ 'design:loaded' event fired
→ isPerformingHistoryOperation = true
   → Skip history initialization ✅
   → Skip auto-fit request ✅
→ loadDesign completes
→ isPerformingHistoryOperation = false
→ History stack preserved, undo available! ✅
→ No visual flashing! ✅
```

## Testing

To verify the complete fix works:

1. **Load a design** → History should be initialized, canvas should auto-fit
2. **Make some changes** (add/delete/modify layers) → History entries should be added
3. **Click Undo** → Should undo the change smoothly without flashing, redo button should remain enabled
4. **Click Redo** → Should redo the change smoothly without flashing, undo button should remain enabled
5. **Repeat undo/redo rapidly** → Should work seamlessly without visual artifacts or history issues

## Key Benefits

1. **Preserves History Stack**: Undo/redo operations no longer reset the history
2. **Maintains Redo Capability**: Users can now undo and then redo as expected
3. **Eliminates Visual Flashing**: No unwanted auto-fit during undo/redo operations
4. **Proper State Management**: Design state remains consistent between store and editor
5. **Robust Flag Management**: History operation flag is properly reset in all scenarios
6. **Clean User Experience**: Smooth undo/redo operations without visual distractions

## Files Modified

1. **`useDesignEditor.ts`**:
   - Added `isPerformingHistoryOperation` flag
   - Updated `design:loaded` event handler to skip history init and auto-fit during history operations
   - Enhanced `loadDesign()` function to always reset the history operation flag
   - Simplified `undo()` and `redo()` methods

2. **`EditorLayout.vue`**:
   - Added missing `handleUndo()` and `handleRedo()` methods
   - Removed duplicate method declarations

The fix ensures that the history service works correctly without interfering with itself during undo/redo operations, while also providing a smooth, flash-free user experience.
