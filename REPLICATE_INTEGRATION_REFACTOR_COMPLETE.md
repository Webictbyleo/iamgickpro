# Replicate Integration Refactor - Complete

## Summary
Successfully refactored the YouTube Thumbnail Generator plugin to fully support user-specific Replicate API tokens via SecureRequestBuilder, removing all direct IntegrationService dependencies and environment variable usage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Plugin Refactoring

#### YoutubeThumbnailPlugin.php
- **Removed IntegrationService dependency**: Completely removed all direct usage of IntegrationService
- **Added InternetConfig import**: Added proper import for InternetConfig class
- **Refactored isReplicateEnabled()**: Now uses SecureRequestBuilder to validate user credentials
- **Updated all Replicate API methods**:
  - `callReplicateAPI()`: Converted from cURL to SecureRequestBuilder
  - `callReplicateAPISingle()`: Converted from cURL to SecureRequestBuilder  
  - `callReplicateAPIMultiple()`: Converted from concurrent cURL to sequential SecureRequestBuilder calls
  - `callMultipleReplicateAPI()`: Converted from concurrent cURL to sequential SecureRequestBuilder calls

#### Key Security Improvements
- **User-specific tokens**: All Replicate API calls now use user-configured API tokens
- **Credential security**: Credentials remain encrypted and are only decrypted during API calls
- **No environment fallback**: Removed dependency on system environment variables
- **Consistent pattern**: All API calls follow the same SecureRequestBuilder pattern as OpenAI

### 2. Configuration Updates

#### youtube_thumbnail.yaml
- **Replicate integration**: Configured as required integration with proper auth settings
- **Credential handling**: Uses "api_key" as credential key to match IntegrationService
- **Bearer token auth**: Properly configured for Replicate's authentication pattern

### 3. Frontend Integration

#### IntegrationsSettings.vue
- **Complete Replicate UI**: Added full integration management interface
- **Connect/Disconnect**: Support for connecting and disconnecting Replicate accounts
- **Test functionality**: Added ability to test Replicate credentials
- **Update tokens**: Support for updating existing Replicate API keys
- **Status management**: Proper loading and error state handling

### 4. Method Refactoring Details

#### API Call Conversion
- **From**: Direct cURL with environment variables
- **To**: SecureRequestBuilder with user credentials via InternetConfig
- **Pattern**: All methods now follow consistent error handling and logging
- **Timeout**: Maintained appropriate timeouts for Replicate's response times

#### Concurrent to Sequential
- **Previous**: Used curl_multi for concurrent API calls
- **Current**: Sequential calls for better error handling and credential security
- **Reason**: SecureRequestBuilder doesn't support concurrent calls, and sequential provides better error isolation

## Integration Flow

### User Experience
1. User navigates to Settings → Integrations
2. User connects Replicate account by entering API key
3. System validates the API key via test call
4. User can now use Replicate-powered thumbnail generation
5. Plugin automatically uses user's Replicate token for all API calls

### Technical Flow
1. Plugin checks user credentials via `isReplicateEnabled()`
2. If Replicate is available, it's used as preferred generation method
3. All API calls go through SecureRequestBuilder with InternetConfig
4. User credentials are automatically injected per plugin configuration
5. Fallback to OpenAI if Replicate is not configured or fails

## Benefits

### Security
- **Encrypted credentials**: User API keys remain encrypted at rest
- **No system dependencies**: No reliance on environment variables
- **User isolation**: Each user's API usage is isolated to their own tokens

### Flexibility
- **User choice**: Users can choose their preferred AI provider
- **No admin setup**: No system administrator configuration required
- **Easy management**: Users can update/remove credentials as needed

### Consistency
- **Unified pattern**: All API integrations follow the same SecureRequestBuilder pattern
- **Error handling**: Consistent error logging and user feedback
- **Configuration**: Standardized plugin configuration approach

## Testing Validation

### Completed Checks
- ✅ PHP syntax validation passed
- ✅ No IntegrationService references remaining
- ✅ No environment variable usage
- ✅ All Replicate calls use SecureRequestBuilder
- ✅ No direct cURL usage remaining
- ✅ Configuration properly structured

### Next Steps for Testing
1. Test user Replicate token connection via frontend
2. Validate API calls work with user tokens
3. Verify error handling for invalid tokens
4. Test fallback behavior when Replicate not configured
5. Validate plugin configuration loading

## Files Modified
- `/backend/src/Service/Plugin/Plugins/YoutubeThumbnailPlugin.php`
- `/backend/config/plugins/youtube_thumbnail.yaml`
- `/frontend/src/components/settings/IntegrationsSettings.vue`
- `/backend/src/Service/IntegrationService.php` (previous changes)
- `/backend/src/Controller/IntegrationController.php` (previous changes)

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The refactoring is complete and ready for testing. All Replicate API integration now uses user-specific tokens through the secure, standardized integration system.
