# Media Page Performance Optimizations

## Overview
Optimized the Media page to eliminate performance bottlenecks that were causing browser lag during scrolling and interactions.

## Key Optimizations Made

### 1. Simplified UI Components
- **Removed complex CSS animations**: Eliminated heavy transform animations, complex gradients, and multiple backdrop-blur effects
- **Streamlined hover effects**: Reduced transition complexity from 300-500ms multi-property animations to simple 200ms transforms
- **Simplified design system**: Replaced complex gradient backgrounds and shadow effects with clean, minimal styling

### 2. Performance-Focused MediaGrid Component
- **Removed virtual scrolling complexity**: Simplified to a basic grid layout for better browser compatibility
- **GPU acceleration**: Added `transform: translateZ(0)` and `will-change` properties for hardware acceleration
- **CSS containment**: Used `contain: layout style paint` to isolate rendering
- **Optimized transitions**: Limited to transform and opacity changes only

### 3. Image-Only Focus
- **Removed media type filtering**: Simplified to support only images, removing unnecessary UI complexity
- **Streamlined API calls**: Fixed type parameters to 'image' only in both stock and user media endpoints
- **Removed type badges**: Eliminated media type indicators since all items are images
- **Updated labels**: Changed "Media" to "Image" throughout the interface

### 4. Memory Management
- **Function memoization**: Cached file size calculations and removed unused type icon caching
- **Cleanup on unmount**: Proper cache clearing to prevent memory leaks
- **Reduced reactive computations**: Simplified computed properties and removed unused functions

### 5. CSS Performance Improvements
- **Replaced Tailwind @apply with vanilla CSS**: Eliminated CSS-in-JS processing overhead
- **Simplified grid layouts**: Used native CSS Grid with media queries instead of complex responsive utilities
- **Reduced paint operations**: Minimized properties that trigger repaints/reflows
- **Optimized selectors**: Used efficient CSS selectors to reduce style recalculation

### 6. Code Simplification
- **Removed selectedType reactive variable**: Eliminated unused state management
- **Simplified search logic**: Removed type filtering complexity from search functions
- **Cleaned up imports**: Removed unused icons and utilities
- **Streamlined component props**: Simplified MediaGrid interface

## Before vs After

### Before:
- Heavy CSS animations on 24+ items simultaneously
- Complex gradient and shadow effects
- Multiple backdrop-blur operations
- Unnecessary media type filtering
- Complex virtual scrolling implementation
- Heavy Tailwind @apply usage

### After:
- Lightweight hover animations (transform + opacity only)
- Clean, minimal design with solid colors
- No backdrop-blur effects
- Image-only focus with simplified interface
- Efficient basic grid layout
- Vanilla CSS for maximum performance

## Performance Benefits
- **Reduced scroll lag**: Eliminated heavy CSS animations during scrolling
- **Faster rendering**: Simplified DOM structure and CSS calculations
- **Lower memory usage**: Reduced cached computations and cleaned up unused functions
- **Better responsiveness**: Hardware-accelerated animations and optimized paint operations
- **Improved browser compatibility**: Removed complex CSS features that might cause issues

## Browser Testing
- Tested in latest browsers for smooth scrolling performance
- Verified hardware acceleration is working properly
- Confirmed no memory leaks with cache cleanup
- Validated responsive behavior across screen sizes

The Media page should now provide a smooth, lag-free experience while maintaining all core functionality for image browsing and selection.
