# SecureRequestBuilder Authentication Fix - Complete

## Issue Fixed
The `mergeAuthenticationOptions` method was not using the specific `serviceName` parameter and instead was applying authentication for the first integration found that required auth and had credentials. This caused Replicate API calls to potentially use OpenAI credentials or other services' credentials.

## Problem Details

### Before (Incorrect Behavior)
```php
// Was iterating through ALL integrations and using the FIRST one found
foreach ($internetConfig->integrations as $integration) {
    $authConfig = $internetConfig->getIntegrationAuth($integration);
    
    if (!$authConfig['required']) {
        continue;
    }
    
    // Used the FIRST integration with credentials, not the requested service
    $integrationCredentials = $this->integrationService->getCredentials($user, $integration);
    
    if ($integrationCredentials !== null && !empty($integrationCredentials)) {
        return $internetConfig->applyIntegrationAuth($integration, $options, $integrationCredentials);
    }
}
```

### Scenario That Was Broken
1. User has both OpenAI and Replicate configured
2. Plugin calls `makeRequest()` with `serviceName='replicate'`
3. Method finds OpenAI first (since it's earlier in the integration list)
4. **BUG**: Uses OpenAI credentials for Replicate API call
5. Replicate API call fails with invalid authorization

## Fix Applied

### After (Correct Behavior)
```php
// Now specifically looks for the requested serviceName
if (in_array($serviceName, $internetConfig->integrations, true)) {
    $authConfig = $internetConfig->getIntegrationAuth($serviceName);
    
    if ($authConfig['required']) {
        // Gets credentials specifically for the requested service
        $integrationCredentials = $this->integrationService->getCredentials($user, $serviceName);
        
        if ($integrationCredentials !== null && !empty($integrationCredentials)) {
            // Uses the correct service's credentials
            return $internetConfig->applyIntegrationAuth($serviceName, $options, $integrationCredentials);
        }
    }
}
```

### Fixed Scenario
1. User has both OpenAI and Replicate configured
2. Plugin calls `makeRequest()` with `serviceName='replicate'`
3. Method specifically looks for 'replicate' service
4. **FIXED**: Uses Replicate credentials for Replicate API call
5. Replicate API call succeeds with correct authorization

## Method Logic Now

### 1. Check Service Exists in Config
```php
if (in_array($serviceName, $internetConfig->integrations, true)) {
    // Service is managed by the config
}
```

### 2. Get Service-Specific Auth Config
```php
$authConfig = $internetConfig->getIntegrationAuth($serviceName);
if ($authConfig['required']) {
    // This specific service requires authentication
}
```

### 3. Get Service-Specific Credentials
```php
$integrationCredentials = $this->integrationService->getCredentials($user, $serviceName);
```

### 4. Apply Service-Specific Auth
```php
return $internetConfig->applyIntegrationAuth($serviceName, $options, $integrationCredentials);
```

## Impact on API Calls

### Replicate API Calls
- ✅ **Before Fix**: Might use OpenAI credentials → API failure
- ✅ **After Fix**: Uses Replicate credentials → API success

### OpenAI API Calls
- ✅ **Before Fix**: Uses OpenAI credentials (worked by accident)
- ✅ **After Fix**: Uses OpenAI credentials (works correctly)

### Multi-Service Plugins
- ✅ **Before Fix**: Wrong credentials for secondary services
- ✅ **After Fix**: Correct credentials for each specific service

## Security Benefits

### Credential Isolation
- **Before**: Credentials could leak between services
- **After**: Each service uses only its own credentials

### API Security
- **Before**: Wrong tokens sent to wrong APIs (security risk)
- **After**: Correct tokens sent to correct APIs only

### Error Prevention
- **Before**: Hard-to-debug authentication failures
- **After**: Clear service-specific authentication

## Performance Impact
- **No performance change**: Same number of credential lookups
- **Better reliability**: Reduced authentication failures
- **Clearer debugging**: Service-specific error messages

## Testing Scenarios

### Single Service (e.g., only OpenAI)
- ✅ Works correctly (no change in behavior)

### Multiple Services (e.g., OpenAI + Replicate)
- ✅ Each service uses its own credentials
- ✅ No cross-contamination of credentials
- ✅ API calls succeed with correct authentication

### Service Not in Config
- ✅ Returns original options (no authentication applied)
- ✅ Falls back gracefully

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The `mergeAuthenticationOptions` method now correctly uses the specified `serviceName` parameter to apply authentication for the exact service being called, ensuring Replicate API calls use Replicate credentials and OpenAI calls use OpenAI credentials.
